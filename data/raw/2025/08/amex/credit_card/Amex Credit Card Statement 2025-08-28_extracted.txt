Interest Free Grace Period and Illustrations
Interest free (grace) period will not be applicable if any balance of the previous month's bill is outstanding, even if the Minimum
Payment Due has been paid.
Interest Illustration
Sample Interest Illustration 1: Assume that you have an American Express Credit Card, have paid the balance on your
previous statement in full and do not have any amount outstanding on your Card Account. Your statement date is the 1st of
every month. You made a purchase on 15th July for Rs.20,000 and on 19th July for Rs. 7,000. Your statement generated 1st
Aug will have a total outstanding of Rs. 27,000, with a minimum due of Rs.1,350. Assume that you have paid the Minimum Due
of Rs 1,350 on the Due Date of 22nd Aug and have made an additional purchase of Rs. 4000 on 28th Aug. In the statement
generated 1st Sep, the total outstanding will be Rs.29,650. With an illustrative interest rate of 3.5% p.m., the interest
calculation will be as follows:
1. Interest on Rs. 20,000, from 15th July – 18th July (4 days) = Rs. 92.05
2. Interest on Rs.27,000 from 19th July – 1st Aug (14 days) = Rs.434.96
3. Interest on Rs.27,000 from 2nd Aug – 21st Aug (20 days) = Rs. 621.37
4. Interest on Rs.25,650 from 22nd Aug – 27th Aug (6 days) = Rs. 177.09
5. Interest on Rs. 29,650 from 28th Aug – 1st Sep (5 days) = Rs. 170.59
Thus, the total interest charged will be Rs.1496 (exclusive of applicable taxes).
Sample Interest Illustration 2: Assume that you have an American Express Credit Card, have paid the balance on your
previous statement in full and do not have any amount outstanding on your Card Account. Your statement date is the 1st of
every month. You have been charged the Annual Fee on your card of Rs.5000 on 1st May and applicable taxes of Rs.900 on 1st
May. Your statement generated on 1st May will have a total outstanding of Rs.5,900 and a minimum due amount of Rs.5,900.
Assume you have not paid the Minimum Due by 22nd May, and made another purchase on 29th May for Rs. 2,000. With an
illustrative interest rate of 3.5% p.m., the interest calculation for the statement generated 1st June will be as follows:
1. Interest on Rs. 2,000, from 29th May – 1st June (4 days) = Rs. 9.21
2. LPC @ 30% of Rs. 5900 (subject to a minimum of Rs. 500 and maximum of Rs. 1000) = Rs.1000
Thus, the total interest charged will be Rs. 9.21 (exclusive of applicable taxes).

*Sample Interest Illustration 3: *Assume that you have an American Express Credit Card and the Minimum Payment Due
has not been paid by the due date thrice in last 12-month period. Hence, your interest rate will be revised from regular 3.5%
p.m. to the interest rate in case of Default of 3.99% p.m. You paid the balance on your previous statement in full and do not
have any amount outstanding on your Card Account. Your statement date is the 1st of every month. You made a purchase on
20th April for Rs.5,000 and another purchase on 25th April for Rs. 10,000. Your statement generated 1st May will have a total
outstanding of Rs.15,000 and a minimum due amount of Rs. 750. Assume you paid Rs.1,000 on 28th May 2022 and then
made another purchase on 29th May 2022 for Rs.2,000. Interest calculation for the statement generated 1st June 2022 will be
as follows:
1. Interest on Rs. 5,000 from 20th April – 24th April (5 days) = Rs. 32.79
2. Interest on Rs.15,000 from 25th April – 1st May (7 days) = Rs. 137.74
3. Interest on Rs. 15,000 from 2nd May – 27th May (26 days) = Rs. 511.59
4. Interest on Rs. 14,000 from 28th May – 28th May (1 day) = Rs. 18.36
5. Interest on Rs. 16,000 from 29th May – 1st June (4 days) = Rs. 83.95
Thus, the total interest charged will be Rs.784.44 (exclusive of applicable taxes).
